# 🌟 The Four Pillars of OOP in C# 12 🌟

Welcome to the world of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C# 12! 🚀 This guide will introduce you to the four fundamental principles of OOP, which are essential for writing robust and maintainable code. Let's dive in! 🏊‍♂️


## 📚 Table of Contents
1. Encapsulation
2. Inheritance
3. Polymorphism
4. Abstraction

## 🔒 Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the practice of keeping fields within a class private, then providing access to them via public methods. This helps to protect the internal state of the object and only expose what is necessary.

## 🧬 Inheritance
Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. This promotes code reusability and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes.

## 🌀 Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon. It can be achieved through method overriding and method overloading.

## 🧩 Abstraction
Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. It can be achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.


## 🎉 Conclusion
Understanding and applying these four pillars of OOP will help you write better, more maintainable code in C# 12. 

Happy coding! 🎉
