## Introduction
Tree data structure is a heirarchical structure that is used to represent and 
organize data in a way that is easy to navigate and search. It is a collection 
of nodes that are connected by edges and has a heirarchical relationship 
between the nodes.

The topmost node of the tree is called root.

The nodes below it are called the child nodes. Each node can have multiple 
child nodes, and these child nodes can also have their own child nodes, 
forming a recursive structure.
