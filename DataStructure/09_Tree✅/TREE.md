## Introduction
Tree data structure is a heirarchical structure that is used to represent and 
organize data in a way that is easy to navigate and search. It is a collection 
of nodes that are connected by edges and has a heirarchical relationship 
between the nodes.

• The topmost node of the tree is called root.
• The nodes below it are called the child nodes. 
• Each node can have multiple 
  child nodes, and these child nodes can also have their own child nodes, 
  forming a recursive structure.

## Why do we need a Tree?
 - When we compare a Tree with other data structures, we need not to mention
   the size of the tree, hence it is space efficient.

 - A linked list has a big O(n) operation for insertion, deletion, searching
   operations; Whereas with Trees we don't have such time complexity problem.

 - Tree data structure plays a crucial role in the industry for organizing 
   the data in a hierarchy so that operations like searching, inserting, 
   and deleting data can be performced efficiently.

 - Easily manageable hierarchical data.

 - Efficient Search and Sort Operations.

 - Tree structures can grow and shrink as required, making them an 
   excellent choice for situations where data might by dynamically added 
   or removed. This is especially true for trees that automatically balance 
   themselves, such as AVL trees or Red-Black trees.
