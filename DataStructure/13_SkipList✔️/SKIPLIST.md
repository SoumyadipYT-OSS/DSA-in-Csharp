## Introduction
Skip Lists are probabilistic data structures that allow efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations in a sorted sequence. They provide an attractive alternative to balanced trees by utilizing multiple levels of linked lists—where each higher level “skips” over several elements of the lower levels—to achieve average-case logarithmic time complexity.

---

## Motivation
Imagine you have a sorted linked list where searching for an item may require scanning many nodes sequentially. A Skip List improves on this by introducing additional “express lanes” (multiple levels) that let you bypass many nodes during a search. The balance between simplicity and speed makes skip lists ideal in many applications requiring fast, dynamic ordered storage.

---

## How Skip Lists Work
A Skip List consists of multiple layers:
- **Bottom Layer (Level 0):** A standard sorted linked list that contains every element.
- **Upper Layers:** Each higher level contains a subset of the elements from the level immediately below. The levels are built probabilistically—a new node is assigned a level based on random chance (with a preset probability), resulting in a tower of forward pointers.
- **Forward Pointers:** Each node stores an array of pointers (one for each level) to the next node at that level. These pointers allow fast traversal across the list.

This multi-level design reduces the average number of comparisons required to locate an element during search, insertion, or deletion.

---

## Operations

### Search
To search for a value:
1. **Start at the Top Level:** Begin from the highest-level pointer of the header node.
2. **Traverse Horizontally:** Move right (follow the forward pointer) until the next node’s value is greater than or equal to the target.
3. **Drop Down:** If the exact value is not found at the current level, drop down one level and continue horizontally.
4. **Repeat:** Continue until reaching level 0 and determine whether the element exists.

### Insertion
To insert a new element:
1. **Traverse and Record:** Use an update array to record nodes at each level where pointer changes are required. Traverse from the top level to level 0 to find the insertion positions.
2. **Random Level Generation:** Compute a random level for the new node using a probability factor (commonly 0.5).
3. **Insert Node:** Update the forward pointers at levels 0 through the newly generated level to include the new node.
4. **Adjust Current Level:** If the new node’s level is higher than the current list level, update the list level accordingly.

### Deletion
To delete a node:
1. **Locate the Node:** Create an update array by traversing the list similarly to insertion.
2. **Remove the Node:** For every level at which the node appears, update the pointers to bypass the node.
3. **Adjust Levels:** If higher levels become empty after deletion, reduce the current level of the list.

---

## Properties
- **Probabilistic Level Assignment:** Nodes are randomly promoted to higher levels, which maintains balance with high probability.
- **Multiple Levels & Forward Pointers:** Enables fast skipping over several nodes during operations.
- **Average-Case Efficiency:** Achieves O(log n) average time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion.
- **Simple and Dynamic:** Unlike strictly balanced trees, skip lists require no complex rotations or rebalancing on updates.

---

## Advantages and Limitations

### Advantages
- **Ease of Implementation:** Skip lists are simpler to implement compared to most balanced binary search trees.
- **Fast Average-Case Operations:** The use of multiple levels yields efficient performance characteristics for dynamic data sets.
- **Dynamic Adjustments:** New elements can be added or removed without heavy restructuring.

### Limitations
- **Worst-Case Performance:** In rare cases of adverse randomization, the worst-case time can degrade to O(n), though this is extremely unlikely.
- **Memory Overhead:** Each node holds multiple pointers, which may consume more memory compared to a basic linked list.
- **Dependence on Randomness:** The performance is tied to the quality and behavior of the random level generator.

## Implementation in C#
Below is a complete C# implementation of a generic Skip List that includes insertion, search, deletion, and a display method.

```csharp
using System;

public class SkipListNode<T> where T : IComparable<T>
{
    public T Value { get; set; }
    public SkipListNode<T>[] Forward { get; set; }

    public SkipListNode(int level, T value)
    {
        Forward = new SkipListNode<T>[level + 1];
        Value = value;
    }
}

public class SkipList<T> where T : IComparable<T>
{
    private const double P = 0.5; // Probability for level generation
    private readonly int maxLevel;
    private int level;
    private readonly SkipListNode<T> header;
    private readonly Random rand = new Random();

    public SkipList(int maxLevel)
    {
        this.maxLevel = maxLevel;
        level = 0;
        header = new SkipListNode<T>(maxLevel, default(T));
    }

    // Generates a random level for the new node.
    private int RandomLevel()
    {
        int lvl = 0;
        while (rand.NextDouble() < P && lvl < maxLevel)
        {
            lvl++;
        }
        return lvl;
    }

    // Insert a new value into the Skip List.
    public void Insert(T value)
    {
        // Create update array to hold pointers that need to be updated.
        SkipListNode<T>[] update = new SkipListNode<T>[maxLevel + 1];
        SkipListNode<T> current = header;

        // Traverse levels from top to bottom.
        for (int i = level; i >= 0; i--)
        {
            while (current.Forward[i] != null && current.Forward[i].Value.CompareTo(value) < 0)
            {
                current = current.Forward[i];
            }
            update[i] = current;
        }
        current = current.Forward[0];

        // Only insert if the value is not already present (assuming unique values)
        if (current == null || current.Value.CompareTo(value) != 0)
        {
            int rLevel = RandomLevel();
            if (rLevel > level)

                }
                level = rLevel;
            }
            SkipListNode<T> newNode = new SkipListNode<T>(rLevel, value);
            for (int i = 0; i <= rLevel; i++)
            {
                newNode.Forward[i] = update[i].Forward[i];
                update[i].Forward[i] = newNode;
            }
        }
    }

        }

        return current != null && current.Value.CompareTo(value) == 0;
    }

    // Delete a value from the Skip List
