A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object, known as a node. Each node contains some data and points 
to the next node in the structure, forming a swquence.

This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position as only the link is needed to be modified to point 
to some other element.


<strong> The Node </strong>
Each node in its basic contains has two portions: the data, and references to the next node in the sequences.
In, C#(sharp) we define Node as a structure that has the data and the reference pointer information.
