# Csharp - ArrayList

In C#, the `ArrayList` is a non-generic collection of objects whose size increases dynamically. It is same
as the `Array`, except that its size increases dynamically.

An *ArrayList* can be used to add unknown number of items to a collection. It is found in the `System.Collections` namespace.
Also to add unknow data where you don't know the types and the size of the data.


The `ArrayList` class is a collection of objects. It is similar to an array,
except that it grows automatically as you add items in it. It is a part of the `System.Collections` namespace.
