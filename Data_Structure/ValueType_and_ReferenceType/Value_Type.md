In C#, value types are stored in the stack memory. Value types are derived from the System.ValueType class. Value types are derived from the System.ValueType class
C# provides the following categories of data types:

1. Value type
2. Reference type
3. Pointer type

A data type is a value type if it holds a data value within its own memory space.
It means variables of these data types directly contain values.

*For example: int i = 100;*
The system stores 100 in the memory space allocated for the variable i. The following
image illustrates how 100 is stored in the memory space allocated for the variable i.
