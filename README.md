## Data Structures and Algorithms

| Data Structure | Description                         | Complexity (Average) |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Array**      | Collection of elements              | O(1) for access      |
| **Linked List**| Sequence of nodes                   | O(n) for access      |
| **Stack**      | LIFO (Last In, First Out) structure | O(1) for push/pop    |
| **Queue**      | FIFO (First In, First Out) structure| O(1) for enqueue/dequeue |
| **Tree**       | Hierarchical structure              | O(log n) for search  |
| **Graph**      | Set of nodes connected by edges     | O(V+E) for traversal |
| **Hash Table** | Key-value pairs                     | O(1) for search      |
