## üîé Data Structures Overview

Below is an overview of the key data structures covered in this repository along with a brief description and their average complexities for typical operations:

| Data Structure             | Description                                                                                           | Complexity (Average)                        |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Array**                  | Fixed-size collection offering constant-time indexed access.                                        | O(1) for access; O(n) for insertion/deletion |
| **ArrayList**              | A resizable, non-generic collection.                                                                  | O(1) amortized for add; O(n) for deletion    |
| **List&lt;T&gt;**           | A generic, dynamic array providing type-safety with efficient random access.                          | O(1) amortized for add; O(n) for removal     |
| **Linked List**            | Sequential collection of nodes with pointers; supports efficient insertion/deletion at the ends.      | O(n) for access; O(1) for insertion/deletion   |
| **Stack**                  | LIFO structure for last-in, first-out operations.                                                   | O(1) for push/pop                           |
| **Queue**                  | FIFO structure for first-in, first-out operations.                                                  | O(1) for enqueue/dequeue                    |
| **Tree**                   | Hierarchical structure for sorted or hierarchical data.                                             | O(log n) for balanced tree operations        |
| **Graph**                  | Consists of vertices connected by edges, used in traversal and network algorithms.                   | O(V+E) for traversal                         |
| **Hash Table/Hash Map**      | Key-value storage offering near-constant time lookups.                                             | O(1) average for search/insertion/deletion     |
| **Bloom Filter**           | Probabilistic data structure for membership queries allowing false positives.                        | O(k) for k hash functions                    |
| **Skip List**              | Layered, probabilistic linked lists offering efficient search, insertion, and deletion.              | O(log n)                                    |
| **Heap**                   | Complete binary tree (often represented as an array) used for priority retrieval.                    | O(1) for peek; O(log n) for insert/delete     |
| **Priority Queue**         | Abstract data type (often implemented using a Heap) for managing elements by priority.               | O(1) for peek; O(log n) for insert/dequeue      |
| **Concurrent Collections** | Thread-safe collections for multi-threaded scenarios (e.g., dictionaries, queues, stacks, bags).        | Varies; generally optimized for concurrency   |
